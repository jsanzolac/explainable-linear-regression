# Explainable Linear Regressions
This repository explores the linear regression algorithm from scracth and goes from validating data and assumptions to train the learning algorithm, to the implementation of techniques used to assess interpretaibility and explainability for Responsible AI purposes.

## Univariate linear regression:

I develop implementation of the model from scratch as well as some most used techniques to explain its decision making process:

  ### For the model:
    * Linear model
    * Cost function (mean squared error)
    * Optimization function (non-sthocastic gradient descent)
  ### For interpretability:
    * Wald chi-square statistic to show the significance of single predictors
    * Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) statistic to show the goodness-of-fit of the model to the data
